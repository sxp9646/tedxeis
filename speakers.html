					<h1>LY Marlow</h1>
					<img class="img-2" src="images/speakers/LYMarlow.jpg" alt="image two" />
					<p>Having grown up in a drug- and crime-infested project in Philadelphia, a product of teen pregnancy, who escaped an unspeakable abusive relationship and then put herself through sixteen years of night school (sometimes with baby in tow) to earn multiple degrees including an MBA, L.Y. Marlow’s story would be notable enough given her tenacity to shatter the status quo. But it would be her courageous decision to step down from a promising 20+ year corporate career to found Saving Promise—a national domestic violence prevention nonprofit inspired by five generations of mothers and daughters in her family that survived more than sixty years of domestic violence, including her granddaughter, a little girl named Promise. Key to the Saving Promise’s vision is a collaboration with the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health to launch one of the first of its kind research and development Learning Labs to put forth innovative, evidence-based public education and preventions strategies to prevent intimate partner violence. This heartfelt and captivating story of tragedy to triumph moved L.Y. to share her journey in her memoir: ‘Don’t Look at the Monster: One Woman’s Journey to Embrace a Purposeful Life—the Gifts, the Lessons & the Blessings’. L.Y. is a dedicated and sought-after media talent, lecturer and spokeswoman for domestic violence prevention and women empowerment. Her authentic voice as a survivor, mother and friend—an ordinary woman with an extraordinary story—is a testament to the transformative power to embrace one’s passion, purpose and power.<br /><br />L.Y. Marlow is the Founder & CEO, Saving Promise; Founder of MonsteRise (a new women empowerment brand); and the award-winning author of Color Me Butterfly, A Life Apart and Don’t Look at the Monster.

					<h1>Shima Ghaheri</h1>
					<img src="images/speakers/ShimaGhaheri.JPG" alt="image four" />
					<p>Graduate Student at The Rochester Institute of Technology<br /><br />Shima was born and raised in Tehran, Iran. She started her journey to become a designer by making her own toys with recyclable materials in her uncle’s basement during pre-school summers.

More recently, she started working at Hasbro, the toy design company, as a product design intern. Throughout her career as a designer, many of her childhood dreams have come true; this time, however, Shima embarks on a challenging and exciting journey to leverage her expertise to realize the dreams of the children living in war zones.<br /><br />More can be found at: <a href="http://shimaghaheri.com/">http://shimaghaheri.com/</a></p>
