				<div class="title">TEDxEkamaiIntlSchool</div>
				<div class="text">TEDxEkamaiIntlSchool started as an idea. A small group of students wanted to make a difference and start conversations on campus. Fast forward two years later. We now have excellent engagement and, with the help of twenty dedicated students, are planning our second annual event. We pride ourselves on being diverse, unique, and as inclusive as possible to all ideas and people. TEDxEkamaiIntlSchool is for the students, by the students, and as our club continues to grow and become more successful, we will never forget why we started and what we strive for.
					<br /><br />In the spirit of "ideas worth spreading," TED granted our club a license to hold our very own Youth TEDx Event, 
featuring a combination of live speakers and performances. Our goal is to spark in-depth discussions and connections within our forward-thinking community. 
TEDxEkamaiIntlSchool embraces the pillars that EIS stands on, 
celebrating the diversity of our community by engaging students and faculty in groundbreaking conversations. </div>

					<div class="text">In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TED has created a program called TEDx. TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. Our event is called TEDxEkamaiIntlSchool, where x = independently organized TED event. At our TEDxEkamaiIntlSchool event, TEDTalks video and live speakers will combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events, including ours, are self-organized.</div>

				<div class="title">About TED</div>
				<div class="text">TED is a nonprofit organization devoted to Ideas Worth Spreading. Started as a four-day conference in California 30 years ago, TED has grown to support its mission with multiple initiatives. The two annual TED Conferences invite the world's leading thinkers and doers to speak for 18 minutes or less. Many of these talks are then made available, free, at TED.com. TED speakers have included Bill Gates, Jane Goodall, Elizabeth Gilbert, Sir Richard Branson, Nandan Nilekani, Philippe Starck, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Sal Khan and Daniel Kahneman.
					<br><br>
					The annual TED Conference takes place each spring in Vancouver, British Columbia. TED's media initiatives include TED.com, where new TED Talks are posted daily; the Open Translation Project, which provides subtitles and interactive transcripts as well as translations from volunteers worldwide; the educational initiative TED-Ed. TED has established the annual TED Prize, where exceptional individuals with a wish to change the world get help translating their wishes into action; TEDx, which supports individuals or groups in hosting local, self- organized TED-style events around the world, and the TED Fellows program, helping world-changing innovators from around the globe to amplify the impact of their remarkable projects and activities.</div>
